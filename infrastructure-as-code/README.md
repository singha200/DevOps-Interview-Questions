## **🚀 Beginner-Level Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Questions (1-20)**

#### *(Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation)*

### **Terraform Questions**  

### **1. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why is it important?**  

**Answer:**  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a **method of managing and provisioning infrastructure** using code instead of manual processes. It allows:  
✅ **Automation** of infrastructure deployment  
✅ **Consistency** by reducing human errors  
✅ **Scalability** through repeatable scripts  

---

### **2. What is Terraform and how does it work?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform is an **open-source IaC tool** by HashiCorp that helps define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It follows three steps:  

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure in `.tf` files  
2. **Plan**: Preview changes before applying  
3. **Apply**: Deploy and manage resources  

Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

### **3. What is the difference between Terraform and Ansible?**  

**Answer:**  

| Feature | Terraform | Ansible |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Type** | Declarative | Imperative |

| **State Management** | Uses state file | Stateless |
| **Example Use** | Creating VMs, Networks | Installing software, configuring OS |

---

### **4. What are Terraform Providers?**  

**Answer:**  
Providers are **plugins** that allow Terraform to manage resources on different platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.).  

Example:  

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

---

### **5. What is a Terraform State File?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform maintains infrastructure details in a **state file (`terraform.tfstate`)**, which:  
✅ Tracks existing resources  
✅ Enables incremental changes  
✅ Supports remote storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob)  

To store state remotely:  

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
  key    = "terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

---

### **6. What is the purpose of `terraform init`?**  

**Answer:**  
It initializes the working directory by:  
✅ Downloading providers  
✅ Setting up backend storage  
✅ Validating configuration  

Command:  

```sh
terraform init
```

---

### **7. How does Terraform manage dependencies between resources?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform uses **implicit and explicit dependencies**:  

- **Implicit:** Recognized automatically  
- **Explicit:** Defined using `depends_on`  

Example:  

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "data" {
  size          = 10
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  depends_on    = [aws_instance.web]
}
```

---

### **8. What is the difference between Terraform `apply` and `plan`?**  

**Answer:**  

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `terraform plan` | Shows proposed changes before applying |
| `terraform apply` | Executes changes to create/update resources |

---

### **9. What is a Terraform Module?**  

**Answer:**  
A **module** is a reusable collection of Terraform configurations that helps **organize** code.  

Example of a module (`main.tf`):  

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
}
```

---

### **10. How do you destroy resources in Terraform?**  

**Answer:**  
Use:  

```sh
terraform destroy
```

This removes all resources defined in the configuration.

---

**10. What is the difference between for_each and for in Terraform?**
**Answer:**
**for_each** is used to create multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set, while **for** is used for iterating over lists or maps to generate values.

**11. What are modules in terraform and why should you use them?**
**Answer:**
Modules are **self-contained packages** of Terraform configurations that can be reused across different projects. They promote **code reusability**, **organization**, and **scalability**.

**12. What is the role of statefile in Terraform?**
**Answer:**
The state file (`terraform.tfstate`) is a **snapshot of the current infrastructure** managed by Terraform. It tracks resource attributes and dependencies, enabling Terraform to manage updates and changes effectively.

**13. Have you considered storing statefile in git instead of AWS S3 or Azure Blob?**
**Answer:**
Storing the state file in Git is **not recommended** due to security risks and potential conflicts. Instead, use remote backends like AWS S3 or Azure Blob for better security and collaboration.

**14. Explain terraform statefile management.**
**Answer:**
Terraform state file management involves:
- **Initialization**: Setting up the state file with `terraform init`.
- **Locking**: Preventing concurrent modifications using remote backends.
- **Versioning**: Keeping track of changes to the state file.
- **Backup**: Regularly backing up the state file to prevent data loss. 

**15. Two devops engineers attempt to update statefile at once. what happens?**
