# **Cloud - DevOps Interview Questions**  

## **Beginner Level (1-20 Questions)**  

### **1. What is cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet. It eliminates the need for owning and maintaining physical hardware, allowing users to access scalable resources on a pay-as-you-go model.  

### **2. What are the different types of cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Cloud computing is classified into three types:  

- **Public Cloud:** Services provided by third-party vendors like AWS, Azure, and GCP, accessible over the internet.  
- **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a provider.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.  

### **3. What are the benefits of cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Scalability:** Resources can be easily scaled up or down.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** No need to invest in physical hardware.

**Mitigation strategies:**  

- Use **multi-cloud** strategies to distribute workloads.  
- Adopt **open-source** and **portable** tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform).  
- Design applications with **cloud-agnostic architectures** using containerization and microservices.  

### **55. What is Kubernetes pod affinity and anti-affinity?**  

**Answer:**  
Pod affinity and anti-affinity define rules for **where Kubernetes pods should be scheduled** based on labels.  

- **Pod Affinity:** Ensures pods are scheduled together (e.g., for performance reasons).

### **61. Explain how will you design a highly available and scalable multi-tier app in aws.
**Answer:**
To design a highly available and scalable multi-tier application in AWS, follow these steps:  
1. **Architecture Overview:**
   - Use a **three-tier architecture**: Presentation Layer (Web Servers), Application Layer (Application Servers), and Data Layer (Database).
   - Deploy each tier in multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** for high availability.
2. **Load Balancing:**
   - Use **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers in different AZs.
3. **Auto Scaling:**
   - Set up **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** for web and application servers to automatically scale in or out based on traffic load.
   - Define scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count.
4. **Database Layer:**
   - Use **Amazon RDS** for relational databases with Multi-AZ deployments for high availability.
   - For NoSQL, consider **Amazon DynamoDB** with on-demand capacity mode for automatic scaling.
5. **Caching:**
   - Implement **Amazon ElastiCache** (Redis or Memcached) to cache frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
6. **Content Delivery:**
   - Use **Amazon CloudFront** as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets closer to users, reducing latency.
7. **Security:**
   - Use **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for fine-grained access control.
   - Implement **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Enable **AWS WAF** to protect against common web exploits.
8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring application performance and setting up alarms.
   - Enable **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing API calls and changes in the environment.
9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Implement regular backups using **Amazon RDS automated backups** or **DynamoDB point-in-time recovery**.
   - Use **AWS Backup** for centralized backup management across services.
10. **Deployment Strategy:**
    - Use **AWS CodeDeploy** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for automated deployments and updates.
    - Consider blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime during updates.

### **62. How will you implement networking compoenents for 3 tier architecture**
**Answer:**
To implement networking components for a three-tier architecture in AWS, follow these steps:

1. **VPC Creation:**
   - Create a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** to isolate your application network.
   - Define the CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).

2. **Subnet Design:**
   - Create **public subnets** for the presentation (web) tier in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
   - Create **private subnets** for the application tier in multiple AZs.
   - Create **private subnets** (with no direct internet access) for the database tier in multiple AZs.

3. **Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway:**
   - Attach an **Internet Gateway** to the VPC for internet access to public subnets.
   - Deploy **NAT Gateways** in public subnets to allow instances in private subnets (app tier) to access the internet securely (for updates, etc.) without exposing them directly.

4. **Route Tables:**
   - Associate route tables to control traffic flow:
     - Public subnets: Route 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet Gateway.
     - Private subnets (app tier): Route internet-bound traffic to the NAT Gateway.
     - Private subnets (db tier): No outbound internet route for maximum security.

5. **Security Groups & Network ACLs:**
   - Use **Security Groups** to control inbound/outbound traffic at the instance level:
     - Web tier: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from the internet.
     - App tier: Allow traffic only from the web tier.
     - DB tier: Allow traffic only from the app tier.
   - Use **Network ACLs** for additional subnet-level security.

6. **Load Balancer:**
   - Deploy an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in public subnets to distribute traffic to web servers in the web tier.

7. **Bastion Host (Optional):**
   - Place a **Bastion Host** in a public subnet for secure SSH access to instances in private subnets.

8. **VPC Endpoints (Optional):**
   - Use **VPC Endpoints** for private connectivity to AWS services (like S3) without traversing the internet.

This setup ensures isolation, security, and scalability for each tier in your architecture.
